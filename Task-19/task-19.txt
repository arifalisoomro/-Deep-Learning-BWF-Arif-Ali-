Welcome back to normal life after routine, last 2 weeks I was highly supportive with all of you, no marked tasks, extensions par extensions, no pressure because most of you were going through exams.

But from today we need to be highly active and quick at performance. I'll drop bundle of tasks in this week, so you have to be ready for it.
