When building a machine learning model, it's essential to split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Here's an overview of each set and their role in the machine learning process:

Training Set: The training set is the portion of the dataset that you use to train your machine learning model. It should contain a sufficient number of examples to allow the model to learn the underlying patterns in the data. You should use the training set to optimize the model's parameters and to adjust its architecture to achieve the best performance.

Validation Set: The validation set is used to evaluate your model's performance during the training process. It's essential to have a validation set because it allows you to monitor your model's performance on data that it has not seen before. By analyzing the model's performance on the validation set, you can make changes to the model's architecture or hyperparameters to improve its accuracy and prevent overfitting.

Test Set: The test set is the portion of the dataset that you use to evaluate the performance of your final model. It's essential to use a separate test set because it provides an unbiased evaluation of your model's performance on data that it has never seen before. If you evaluate your model on the same data that you used for training or validation, you risk overfitting and obtaining overly optimistic results.

When splitting your dataset, it's important to ensure that each set contains a representative sample of the data. You should also ensure that the data is split randomly to avoid introducing bias into your model. Finally, you should be careful not to leak information from one set to another, as this can also lead to biased results.

Examples:

1) Image Classification: Let's say you have a dataset of 10,000 images of animals, and you want to build an image classification model to classify them into cats, dogs, and birds. You could split the dataset into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This would result in 7,000 images for training, 1,500 for validation, and 1,500 for testing.

2) Natural Language Processing: Suppose you have a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews, and you want to build a sentiment analysis model to classify them as positive or negative. You could split the dataset into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This would result in 40,000 reviews for training, 5,000 for validation, and 5,000 for testing.

In all these examples, the training set is used to train the model's parameters and optimize its architecture, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust its hyperparameters to improve its accuracy, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance on data it has never seen before.
